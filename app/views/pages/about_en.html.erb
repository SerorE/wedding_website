      <div class = "title">The holiday of Hannukah </div>
<div class = "sub-title">History</div>
  <div class = "text-description">Following the death of Alexander the Great, his empire is divided amongs its generals. Syria, of which the land of Israel then belongs to, is attributed to the Seleucids. Their king Antochius IV wants to wishes to impose the Greek culture to all and decreed that the jewish Temple should direct its sacrifices to Greek gods. The Jews rose up in a revolt led by Matathias (<span class = "italique"> Matityahou</span> ), and his sons, including  Judah (<span class = "italique"> Yehouda </span>) the Maccabee. The result of the armed struggle led to the reestablishment of Jewish sovereignty. Following their victory, Judah and his brothers ordained that 8 days remembering of that should take place every year, starting on the 25th day of Kisleiv, the 9th month of the Jewish calendar.</div>

    <div class = "text-description"> In the talmudic era, Rabbis reinterpreted the story. As the Jews entered the Temple that had been defiled by the Seleucids, they found just enough consecrated oil to relight the Temple candelabrum (the <span class = "italique">Menorah</span> ) for one day, whereas it would take them a full week to produce new supplies of oil. The oil that was meant to keep the Menorah burning for a single day lasted all of eight days, this is the miracle of Hannukah.</div>


<div class = "sub-title">Lighting the candles</div>
<div class = "text-description"> The main <span class = "italique">mitsvah</span> )mistvah (good deed) of Hannukah's festival is the lighting of the Menorah, to commemorate the miracle.
