  <div class = "title">Getting married on Hannukah</div>
  <div class = "text-description"> As Hannukah is considered a minor festival in the Jewish calendar, it is  possible to get married on Hannukah. However, the astute will have noticed that the wedding will not truly be on Hannukah, as the religious ceremony will take place just before sunset... </div>

      <div class = "title">The holiday of Hannukah </div>
<div class = "sub-title">History</div>
  <div class = "text-description">Following the death of Alexander the Great, the Greek empire was divided among the generals. Syria, of which the land of Israel then belonged, was given to the Seleucids. Their king, Antochius IV, wanted to impose Greek culture on all and decreed that the Jewish Temple should direct its sacrifices to Greek gods. But the Jews, led by Matathias (<span class = "italique">Matityahou</span>),  and his sons (including Judah (<span class = "italique">Yehouda</span>) the Maccabee refused and rebelled. They were victorious and reestablished Jewish sovereignty. Following their victory, Judah and his brothers proclaimed 8 days of celebration to take place every year, starting on the 25th day of Kisleiv, the 9th month of the Jewish calendar.</div>

    <div class = "text-description"> In the Talmudic era, the Rabbis embellished the story. As the Jews entered the Temple that had been defiled by the Seleucids, they found just enough consecrated oil to relight the Temple candelabrum (<span class = "italique">Menorah</span>) for only one day and not the full eight day period. Miraculously, the small vial of oil, instead, lasted all eight days. This is the miracle of Hannukah.</div>


<div class = "sub-title">Lighting the candles</div>
<div class = "text-description"> The main <span class = "italique">mitsvah</span> (good deed) of Hannukah's festival is the lighting of the Menorah to commemorate the miracle. The Menorah is composed of 9 branches, one for each day of Hannukah, plus an additional one to hold the <span class = "italique">shamash</span>, the candle used to lit the other ones. The lighting is traditionally followed by two songs:
<ul>
  <li>Haneirot Halalu</li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_bAqvYedIM" target = "_blank" >Maoz Tsur</a>, "Stronghold of Rock", retells the revolt of the Maccabees and other biblical events during which the Jews have survived persecution.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class = "sub-title">And of course...</div>

  <div class = "text-description"> Food is involved. Latkes and doughnuts (<span class="italique">suvganiot</span>) are traditionally eaten on Hannukah. But you're going to have to wait for desert...</div>
